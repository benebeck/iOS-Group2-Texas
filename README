This project is part of the iOS course on App programming of the University of Heidelberg (Germany) in spring 2012. It serves as repo for group 2.

The aim of the course is to develop an App from the very beginning and bring it to the App Store finally. The task is to program an App that allows playing the Poker variant 'Texas Hold'em' versus other players or the computer.
